# FRC team 3407

## Who We Are

We are the Robotics team of Mounds View High School; Team 3407: Wild Cards. Every year, we compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Our team is given 6 weeks to design, prototype, build, test, and perfect a robot to complete the tasks required in the competition.

We strive to teach our students skills that will not only help our team's performance, but also to help them develop skills. Students in Robotics will learn skills in leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and many other skills that may help them succeed in their future STEM or non-STEM endeavors. We encourage knowledge, strength, and interest in STEM.
