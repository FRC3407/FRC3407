## We accept new members during september. Here is how to register for the team:

### Step 1: Registration through FIRST

Go to [firstinspires.org](firstinspired.org).
PARENTS need to set up or log into their PARENT account, then (re)register your STUDENT team member(s).

Please note: student emails in their profiles must be different from parent emails. We are FRC team 3407 based at Mounds View High School in Arden Hills. Remember to sign off on the Consent & Release.

### Step 2: Turn in this year's MSHSL Eligibility Statement

Robotics is an official Team Sport in Minnesota, so the Minnesota State High School League eligibility and expectations apply.  That means members must have best behavior 24/7; no drinking, drugs, smoking, or disrespectful behavior will be tolerated.  The "Eligibility Statement" summarizes the Pledge you make to the team, so please review it and sign it together before you fill out our Google form in step 3.  Robotics teams do NOT need a sports physical, and we do NOT need to review concussion awareness.

### Step 3: Registration through MVHS' google form

 /link/ -  Parents and Students together, please!

### Step 4: Parental Consent Form

Parental Consent Form should be signed and returned to give students permission to use the software tools the team will use for CAD,  communications, storage and some training.

### Step 5: Activity Fees

a. The activity fee for Fall semester is $125.00, which includes personal safety glasses.  Checks may be made to MVHS Robotics (we cannot accept payment through PayPAMS) and may be placed in our mailbox in the Activities Office or brought to our next meeting.  Please contact lpvervena@gmail.com if you need to request a fee waiver or set up a payment plan.
  
b. An activity fee of $75.00 will also be assessed for Fall team members who are eligible to continue into Spring semester.  This fee may be reduced incrementally as each student may earn credits in the Fall by productively engaging in assigned tasks,  Credits earned in the Fall may reduce the fee to $0.00, so please do not pay in advance.  Credits may also be lost.
